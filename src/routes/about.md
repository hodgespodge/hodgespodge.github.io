Thanks for visting my website!

I'm a North Carolina native from the Asheville area. Currently I'm enjoying living in the Triangle area. This website is mostly for professional stuff so the personal information might be a bit limited. Shoot me a message on LinkedIn and we can chat.

## Education

I've been in school for the past 20 years so most of what I have to say is about school. In highschool, I received my initial introduction to computer programming with MATLAB. We used MATLAB to simulate projectile motion with drag using eulers method for solving first order differential equations (ODEs). Since then, I've been hooked on interdisciplinary problems in CS.

I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Asheville (UNCA) in 2020 with a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. During my junior and senior years, I was an active contributer to the [GillesPy2 project](https://github.com/StochSS/GillesPy2). GillesPy2 is a library for stochastically simulating systems of reaction equations such as Michaelisâ€“Menten enzyme kinetics.

From fall 2020 until spring 2023, I have attended North Carolina State University (NCSU) in persuit of my Masters. During my time at NCSU, I have taken a variety of fantastic graduate courses as well as acted as a teaching assistant (TA) for a number of undergraduate ones. Most significantly, I have researched under Dr. John-Paul Ore in the [robot code lab](https://robotcodelab.com/about/) investigating how we can improve the overall robot software development process. Robots are, unsurprisingly, very complex systems which require a lot of testing. But how much testing do they need exactly? One way in which software engineers estimate the completeness of a test suite, is by using "coverage criteria" to measure how much of the underlying system has been executed during testing. By first looking at which parts of a robot's system are ignored by its test suite, we may begin to create more reliable and safer robots. In 2022, I created a tool for measuring test coverage on robot Behavior Trees called [Canopy](https://github.com/RobotCodeLab/BT-Canopy). Behavior trees are a state-based model for system execution which are growing in popularity among robot developers. Stay tuned for news on my upcoming paper: *Canopy: Coverage Measurement for Behavior Trees*.

## Hobbies

My partner and I are avid orchid collectors (among other house plants). Back in Asheville, I worked part-time at an orchid greenhouse throughout highschool and undergrad. If you have any questions about orchid care, please feel free to reach out.

Additionally, I'm a big fan of table-top games, music, nature and anything else that's sciency and cool. 

## Bonus
